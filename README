Greetings Traveler!

I wrote this project to help people keep in touch with their friends and family while traveling, moving to another
country, or fleed from their home country.

This thing is a very simple Telegram bot that allows you to get the address of your friend (who has previously shared
his/her/their address with a bot) and send him a postcard, letter, or any other thing you want to send to make your friend happy.

The code and architecture of this project were born out of my experience, but 100% chaotically. Plan was changed many times, at first it has a completely different purpose. I'm a professional coder, but I was aiming to make a working thing as fast as possible.
So, I just wrote a code that works. I'm not proud of how this thing works, there is a lot of room for improvement here, but I'm proud that I did it in ~2 working days.

Feel free to use this code for your own purposes, though, I'm not responsible for anything. Just have fun.
